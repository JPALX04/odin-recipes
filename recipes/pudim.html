    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Brazilian flan, also known as caramel pudding or creme caramel, is a
      delectable dessert enjoyed worldwide for its silky-smooth texture and rich
      sweetness. This classic dessert typically consists of a layer of
      caramelized sugar at the base, topped with a velvety custard mixture made
      from eggs, milk (full-fat for the best flavor), condensed milk, vanilla
      extract, and sometimes flour.

    <ol>
      <li>
        In a blender, put all the ingredients and blend for 2 to 3 minutes until
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a pan over medium heat, add a cup of sugar and stir until it is
        completely caramelized, then add 30ml of hot water and continue
        stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        After mixing everything, turn off the heat and pour the syrup into the
        pudding mold and then add the dough,<strong> gently and slowly</strong>,
        as the dough cannot mix with the syrup,
        <strong>it is necessary to do the process in that order</strong>, so
        that at the time After un-molding, the syrup stays on top of the
        pudding.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, cover the pan with aluminum foil and place the pan in a water bath
        in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for 40 minutes. Note: The time will depend
        on the power of your oven, I recommend that you add hot water when
        placing it in the water bath speed up the process.

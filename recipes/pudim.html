        <p>
          Brazilian flan, also known as caramel pudding or creme caramel, is a
          delectable dessert enjoyed worldwide for its silky-smooth texture and
          rich sweetness. This classic dessert typically consists of a layer of
          caramelized sugar at the base, topped with a velvety custard mixture
          made from eggs, milk (full-fat for the best flavor), condensed milk,
          vanilla extract, and sometimes flour.

              In a blender, put all the ingredients and blend for 2 to 3 minutes
              until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              With a pan over medium heat, add a cup of sugar and stir until it
              is completely caramelized, then add 30ml of hot water and continue
              stirring.
            </li>
            <li>
              After mixing everything, turn off the heat and pour the syrup into
              the pudding mold and then add the dough,<strong>
                gently and slowly</strong
              >, as the dough cannot mix with the syrup,
              <strong>it is necessary to do the process in that order</strong>,
              so that at the time After un-molding, the syrup stays on top of
              the pudding.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, cover the pan with aluminum foil and place the pan in a
              water bath in a preheated oven at 180Â°C for 40 minutes. Note: The
              time will depend on the power of your oven, I recommend that you
              add hot water when placing it in the water bath speed up the
              process.

        <p>
          Strawberry cheesecake is a delightful dessert that combines the
          richness of cheesecake with the vibrant sweetness of strawberries.
          This classic dessert typically features a creamy and light cheesecake
          base, often made with cream cheese, sugar, eggs, sour cream, and
          vanilla extract, poured over a graham cracker crust. The highlight of
          a strawberry cheesecake is the luscious strawberry topping, which can
          vary from fresh strawberry slices to a strawberry sauce or puree.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Grind the cornstarch biscuit until it resembles crumbs and
              separate it into a container. Melt the margarine in the microwave
              and then pour it over the cornstarch biscuits, mix everything
              until the dough stops sticking to your hands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Separate the cream cheese, condensed milk and cream inside the
              blender. Place 5 tablespoons of water in a pan and add the
              unflavored gelatin, stir until it boils and throw it into the
              blender with the other ingredients. To enhance the flavor, also
              add a pinch of salt to the filling.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place the cornstarch cookie dough in a mold with a removable
              bottom, mold the dough into the shape of the mold and pour the
              finished filling on top, place the mold in the refrigerator and
              let it cool for about an hour.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the topping, place the frozen strawberries in a pan and wait
              for it to melt until the strawberries are soft enough to mash.
              After mashing all the strawberries, add sugar and half a lemon. To
              thicken the icing, make a mixture of cornstarch with a little
              water, add it to the icing and mix well. Once the topping is
              ready, place it in another container with a lid and leave it in
              the fridge until it cools.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once everything is well cooled, remove it from the fridge and pour
              the topping over the filling, remove the sides of the removable
              bottom mold and that's it!
